# npr-streams-web

a hella quick api for a buttload of npr stations

## why?
Streaming from the npr site can be pretty shotty, something that has
been causing distress for myself and my roommates for quite sometime.
Instead of just getting better internet I decided to write a [cli](https://github.com/meandavejustice/npr-stream) for
myself. But on the 6th day of Hanukkah 2014 I thought I'd heard enough kvetching
from my roommates, and created this web client. enjoy.

## Install

* `npm install`
* `npm run load`
* `npm run start`
